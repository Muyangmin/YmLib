### YmLib
This project is planning to create a widely applicable, easy to use, powerful but light weight foundation library for most modern Android applications.

### [ChangeLog](./CHANGELOG.md)

### Features
* lots of extension methods used in real practical projects
* 100% compatible with Kotlin idiomatic usage
* jCenter & jitPack support and version management
* light weight dependency
* powerful helper class and ui widgets across several domains (in core library)
* common third party library extensions without transition dependencies (in independent modules)

### Not in plan 
* api support for pre 21
* Java style api (if conflict with Kotlin idiomatic)
* android support package (if conflict with androidX)
